When the server is on a secured computer, you canâ€™t host directly. However, you can still connect to other servers. The idea is to broadcast game info to a trusted hub (such as a pub, school, or workshop) online. That hub then relays the information locally to others.

Two situation comme to my mind.

You want to make coding tournament between schools. You can broadcast 50 to 800 connections per N schools. |
But you can send the information to a server of the local organiser in ws or wss, then they broadcast it to the student.

The other situation is about sending information to a Esp32, PiPico when we detect that the ip is active.
